Modern Gpt-4 UI

ðŸš€ Modernizing OpenAI's GPT-4 Website UI ðŸš€

Welcome to the GPT-4-Modern-UI repository! This project was undertaken as an opportunity to learn and practice React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, and Git, a version control system.

## About

The primary focus of this project is to modernize the user interface of OpenAI's GPT-4 website. Through the process of enhancing the design and user experience, I aimed to gain valuable experience with React components, state management, and responsive web development. This project also provided the chance to solidify my understanding of Git's version control concepts, branching, and collaboration workflows.

## Learning Goals

- Develop a functional and visually appealing UI using React
- Gain hands-on experience with component-based architecture
- Explore responsive design principles for a seamless user experience
- Practice Git commands for version control and collaborative development
